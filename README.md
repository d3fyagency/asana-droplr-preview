# asana-droplr-preview Chrome Extension
This project is still under development and not ready for publication. However, it does work (with our current custom Droplr URL).

To test on Chrome:

1. Open up chrome://extensions/ in your browser and click “Developer mode” in the top right;
2. Click "Load unpacked extension…";
3. Select the extension’s directory

Whenever the code is updated, you will have manually click on the Reload link in the Chrome Settings tab:
